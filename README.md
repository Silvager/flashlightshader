# Flashlight Shader
This shader aims to make the dark more intense in minecraft, and give the player a tool to use to explore it.
## Flashlight
Torches or any light-emitting things will act as a flashlight if held in main or offhand.
## Increased Darkness
If you are in a decently well lit area, you can see normally.
If there is a small amount of light (like on the surface at night), you can see a small area around you in black and white (because there's not enough light for the color receptors in Steve's eyes). The size of this area depends on how big the moon is.
If there is no light at all, well, you will be able to see nothing at all.
